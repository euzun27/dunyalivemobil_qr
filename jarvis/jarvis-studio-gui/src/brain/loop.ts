/**
 * The observe → act loop. One "turn" = the model thinks, optionally calls tools,
 * sees the real results, and produces a final spoken reply.
 *
 * Ports two loops from the Python brain:
 *   - the conversational route loop in `main.py` (single round of tool calls), and
 *   - the multi-step agent loop in `autopilot.py` (the `phone_task`/`pc_task` path),
 *     which adds cycle/loop guards, a redo-guard, and the vision-first operator.
 *
 * This scaffold implements the SHAPE (bounded tool-call rounds with a truthful
 * final answer) plus a same-repeat guard mirroring the phone operator's cycle guard
 * (scaled down: with only MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS=3 rounds there's no room for the
 * operator's longer window-based cycle detector to matter — the useful signal at
 * this scale is "the model just repeated an identical call and got an identical
 * result", which means one more round won't help either).
